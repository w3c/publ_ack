# Script to generate the acknowledgement section in W3C document

The script extracts the current membership of a Working/Interest Group using the relevant [W3C API](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/), and generates an HTML fragment that can be pulled into the final document. A separate section, calling out the main contributors, is generated based on a configuration file. (An example for the generated content can be seen, e.g., at the [WPUB spec's acknowledgement section](https://w3c.github.io/wpub/).)

THIS IS NOT YET OPERATIONAL, UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
