/**
 *
 * To run this script:
 *
 * - use npm to install the node-fetch and underscore libraries
 * - get an API key (see https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and fill the value int "api_key"
 * - if you want to use this script using local data (eg, in your local github clone)
 *      - check the "local_ack" below to set a localhost URL
 * - if you want to use this script using remote data
 *      - make sure the localhost variable is set to false
 *
 * That is it. The extra data downloaded from localhost or from github is the list of the people
 * who should be called out separately in the acknowledgment section. Note that the structure in that list can also
 * have an "affiliation" member to be set separately; that may be useful if you want to acknowledge the contribution
 * of a person who is not member of the WG any more (ie, the affiliation will not be filled automatically).
 *
 * Otherwise the data is downloaded via the W3C API. Be patient: if the group is large, at some point it sends out a large number of
 * HTTP requests to get the data of all people...
 *
 * You can adapt it to other WG-s: the various strings and the value of publ_wg must be changed
